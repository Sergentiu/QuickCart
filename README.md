## Smart Shopping Platform with AI Chatbot and 2FA Security

This project is an advanced e-commerce platform that combines machine learning, an AI chatbot, and Google Authenticator-based two-factor authentication (2FA) to deliver a secure, personalized shopping experience.

The platform leverages sophisticated AI-driven features to analyze each customer’s purchase history, browsing behavior, and preferences. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, it identifies patterns and trends in the data, enabling it to predict and recommend products that align with individual customer interests. The AI chatbot enhances user interaction by providing real-time assistance and personalized responses based on the customer’s previous interactions and inquiries.

The recommendation engine employs collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches to ensure that the suggestions are relevant and tailored to each user’s unique preferences. This creates a smooth and intuitive shopping journey, making it easier for customers to discover products they are likely to enjoy.

Enhanced security measures, including encrypted sessions and two-factor authentication, ensure the user’s data is protected. This modern, customer-centric solution combines advanced security with intelligent e-commerce features, offering a seamless and secure shopping experience.
